# AI logic

The coordinates of where the balls is expected to be is cheesed everytime P1 loses and the ball is redirected towards Bob (the Bot) or player 1 changes the x direction of the ball by hitting it with their racket. Buggy, sometimes works sometimes doesnt, but on the bright side you can actually win against it.

# Future Improvements

- Limited movement, only moves diagonally (hypotenuse of a 1 by 1 square)
- Figure out more updateable and INTELLIGENT artificial INTELLIGENCE if you can even call it that in this version
- When the pong meets a racket's top or bottom side, it does an awkward movement

# Controls
